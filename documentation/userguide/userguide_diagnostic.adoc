== First connexion and Password change

image::UG_Diagnostic_001.PNG[Connexion Screen]

The first step to do is to change the password. For that, just click on the ‘Forgotten your Password?’ link, and put the mail which should be on the database.

image::UG_Diagnostic_002.PNG[Forgotten Your Password]

Then mail will be sent to you.

image::UG_Diagnostic_003.PNG[Mail Send]

By clicking the link ‘NEW PASSWORD’ in the mail, you will get into a page where you can change your password. You only need to put the new one into the two text fields, and then just click on the ‘Change Password’ button. If the mailing address is not found on the database, the mail will not be sent.

image::UG_Diagnostic_004.PNG[Change Password]

Then, you just need to create your first own diagnostic. For that, just log in to the main connexion screen, by giving your mail and your new password. Then, just click on the ‘Log in’ button.

WARNING: If you are on the Virtual Machine, you will NOT have any mail server installed by default. So you wont receive any mail unless you install one. You can also use a script included in the virtual machine to change manually a password of any user [_Path_to_Diagnostic_]/scripts/changePassword.sh

TIP: This script should be used only in a closed environment which does not have a network connexion. This script needs to have the username of the user that wants to change his password. (Ex: `./changePassword.sh "diagnostic@cases.lu"`). The password needs to have at least a lower case, an upper case, a digit and a special char, and at least 8 characters.

== Begin a Diagnostic as a User

image::UG_Diagnostic_005.PNG[Main Page – Information about organisation]

On the header, at the right side (**1.** on the picture), you can set, by clicking on the corresponding button, your language (**French** and **English** are the two only choice right now). You can also disconnect by clicking on the ‘Log out’ button. Also, if you are administrator of the application, you should see the admin menu access button near the red button use to disconnect.

On the top of the screen but below the header, at left, you could see a button where you could just resume form an old diagnostic (**2.** on the picture).

Just below, you have the navigation panel (**3.** on the picture), which we will describe just a little later. Same for the two buttons used to get the report or save the current Diagnostic (**4.** on the picture).

Finally, on the right of the screen, you have a free-text panel, where you should put some text which will be in the report (**5.** on the picture). Most of the time, the introduction is used to give the context of this diagnostic, and some info that could be useful when you read the report.

image::UG_Diagnostic_006.PNG[Main Page – Information about organisation with text]

Then, to save your work, you should just hit ‘Record and continue’. In the navigation panel, the theme should be green to indicate that there is already some text.

The summary, which is the last part of the Diagnostic, is a short description of the most important points in it. The most important recommendations, what should be done next…

Those are the only free text fields which are present.

After saving the first information, you will be redirected to the first question.

As you can see in the navigation panel, there are eight big themes, which can contain some questions. The red color is mainly used on the theme where you currently are. The question which is black and bold is the current one. The green one is saved and contains text. By clicking on the main theme, question about it will appear, and then you can go on the questions by clicking on them.

The red cross near the question is for delete the question for this diagnostic.

WARNING: If you make a new one, the question will appeared again. If you want to make it disappear for all diagnostic that you make, you should just go in the administration panel to delete it.

image::UG_Diagnostic_007.PNG[Main Page – Navigation Panel]

You can also add questions by clicking the red image:UG_Diagnostic_008.PNG[+ Add a question] button.

WARNING: Be careful, when you do add a question this way, it will be only last during this diagnostic. If you want to add a question for all yours diagnostic, you should add it in the administration part.

image::UG_Diagnostic_009.PNG[Add Question]

You will have the question field to add the question as it will appear into the report. The info field is for details which are displayed only for the question creator. It’s useful to add details to the question, or have a reminder of the main points to talk about.

The threshold is a little more difficult to use. To put it simply, this is the weight in the category of the question.

Let’s take an example:

Imagine you need a specific question on the BYOD, and you think this should be really important. You have, in the same category, a question less important.

If the threshold are respectively 60 and 40, then the maturity on a level is calculated this way: __\((60/3 x maturity) + (40/3 x maturity))__ where the maturity could be 0 if not managed, 1 if scheduled, 2 if more or less managed and 3 if managed. So if a policy is scheduled about BYOD and the other question is managed, the category will be __\((60/3 x 1) + (40/3 x 3)) = 20 + 40 = 60__ out of 100 (The maximal possible) of maturity for this category.

Finally, just hit the green ‘Add’ button to add your new question and get back on the main page.

image::UG_Diagnostic_010.PNG[Main Page – First Question]

On the right side, you have a text field ‘Note’ where you can put what you have seen, what has been said during the interview, precision about what you want…

The maturity panel is where you can set the current maturity on a scale of four levels (managed, more or less managed, scheduled, not managed). You will also have bullet points to think when you ask the question, what you should have in mind when you asking it, and what kind of answer you should have.

The maturity target panel is the maturity level that the company should have. It’s not necessarily managed, so the information security could be adapted from a company to another.

The recommendation panel is the place where you could just put what the company should do to have a better information security.

Finally, the gravity panel is to determine how much the recommendation should be quickly implemented. For saving, as before, just hit ‘Record and continue’.

== Administration Panel

=== User Tab

You have two tabs (On the blue header), the first one is for Users, and the second one is about the Questions.

image::UG_Diagnostic_011.PNG[Administration Panel – User]

You can see all the mail addresses which are authorised to connect to the diagnostic. You can click on the image:UG_Diagnostic_014.PNG[+ Add a user] button, so you can add a user.

image::UG_Diagnostic_015.PNG[Administration Panel – Add User]

You can put a mail address, choose if this account has access to this interface, and just add it by clicking the blue button ‘Add’.

On the page where you can see all mail which is allowed to connect to the Diagnostic, if you click on them, you should be able to modify the address or choose whether it is admin or not.

image::UG_Diagnostic_016.PNG[Administration Panel – Modify User]

TIP: The only way to modify a password is to get a password Forgotten link, or the script which is with the Virtual Machine.

You can also delete an user by clicking on the right side, the red button where "Delete" is written.

WARNING: Be extremely careful, there is no confirmation message when you delete a user here.

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]

=== Questions Tab

==== Question Screen

The second tab list all the default questions that will appear when you open a new Diagnostic.

image::UG_Diagnostic_017.PNG[Administration Panel – Questions]

In the ‘Question’ column, you have all the questions that will appear. The translation key is mainly used to link questions through all languages. The category is, of course, the main theme linked, and the threshold could be assimilated to the maturity that will bring a managed control. To finish, the ‘action’ column represents the possibility to edit the question (by clicking the pen (image:UG_Diagnostic_012.PNG[Pen])) or delete it (by clicking the cross (image:UG_Diagnostic_013.PNG[Cross])).

==== Add a Question

You can also add questions by clicking the red image:UG_Diagnostic_008.PNG[+ Add a question] button.

image::UG_Diagnostic_018.PNG[Administration Panel – Add Questions]

The first field is for the translation key used by the PO file. The built-in question is done by giving two underscores, the tag "question" and the number of the questions (For example, "__question33").

TIP: If the question is not found in the PO file, then the translation key will be displayed. So if you don't intend to used these files, you can just put your question directly in the translation key.

There are no obligations about it.

You can also choose the category of the question, and its upper threshold as if you were adding a question which is not definitive.

The diagnostic uses the PO files for translations. On the language folder ([__Path_to_Diagnostic__]/languages), you will find the .po files (uncompressed) and the .mo files (compiled).

You can modify manually .po files to add an entry with a text editor, or a PO file editor (Like https://poedit.net/[POEdit]).

image::UG_Diagnostic_019.PNG[Edition of the PO File on Notepad++]

If you want to add the translation in another language, you need to modify the other file (In this example, the language is fr_FR).

image::UG_Diagnostic_020.PNG[French translation of the question in Notepad++]

Then, you will find the question in every diagnostic you will do.

image::UG_Diagnostic_021.PNG[Question added]

==== Change a Question

By editing, you will get on a similar interface as if you were adding a question. You can change details on the same ways, as you will also need to change .po and .mo files.

image::UG_Diagnostic_022.PNG[Administration Panel – Change Questions]

==== Delete a Question

Just click on the blue cross (image:UG_Diagnostic_013.PNG[Cross]) to definitly delete the question.

WARNING: Be extremely careful, there is no confirmation message when you delete a question here.

== Resume or finish a Diagnostic

Before your session ends for security reason, or if you want to resume your diagnostic later, it is recommended to export often your work, by hitting the yellow button below the navigation panel.

image::UG_Diagnostic_023.PNG[Exported file]

Files are renamed by the following name:
data_yyyymmddhhnnss.cases where

* y = year
* m = month
* d = day
* h = hour
* n = minutes
* s = second.

There are two ways to load this diagnostic. The first one, at the connexion screen, doesn’t need to have an account to go on it.

image::UG_Diagnostic_001.PNG[Connexion Screen]

By doing this, you will have only access to the report this way. It is mostly used to have another quick way to show an overview of the report.
The other way is on the main page that you access just after getting connected.

image::UG_Diagnostic_024.PNG[Resume a Diagnostic]

Just on the top of the navigation panel, you can load the file that you have downloaded, or that someone gives to you to resume or modify the Diagnostic.

== Report

=== Online Report

You can access to the screen report by just clicking on the yellow button image:UG_Diagnostic_025.PNG[Report]. You can also get this screen without being connected, but you will not be able to download the report as a ‘.docx’.

image::UG_Diagnostic_026.PNG[Report Screen]

The first graph that you can see is the maturity by domains with the risk cartography and more precisely with the tab on the right. You will also find the recommendation tab which briefly summarises the recommendations, their gravity and their current and target maturity.

image::UG_Diagnostic_027.PNG[Recommendation Tab]

Just below the first tab, you will find the current maturity level and the target level.

Most of that data will be found on the document.
The document will be named [__Document Name__]_Date.docx.

image::UG_Diagnostic_031.PNG[Report Downloaded]
